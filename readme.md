For my final project, I was thinking of doing another infographic. I wanted to compare the number of Pizza Huts in each state vs. the number of Domino’s and see which is more popular per state. I want to have a grid of each state’s name alphabetically, and when you hover over the name, the logo of which franchise has more locations in that state will appear (or else just the name if it’s too hard to make that work).



Edit this with your description of your final project.

Your final project must:
- Be organized in an object oriented way meaning that you utilize constructor functions as well as organizing your functions.
- Two objects made from classes you define must interact with one another
- Correct use of loops (no prevalent similarly repeated operations)
