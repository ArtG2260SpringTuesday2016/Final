Edit this with your description of your final project.

I am continuing to work on my infographic. It is about snow, I am going to make it ultra interactive so that when you scroll over something you can see the inches in snow, I also want you to be able to look at all the information and compare it so I am adding buttons that allow you to see the average of snowfall between two days.
