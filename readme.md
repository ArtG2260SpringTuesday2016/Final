Your final project must:
- Be organized in an object oriented way meaning that you utilize constructor functions as well as organizing your functions.
- Two objects made from classes you define must interact with one another
- Correct use of loops (no prevalent similarly repeated operations)

Due on April 29, 2016 **no late work will be accepted.**

For my final project, I will build Tetris in p5.js.
This requires:

-The 7 tetrad shapes (O, T, L, J, Z, S, I) which I will make using constructor functions
-An array of objects which store the shapes
-Keypress functions (so that the shapes can turn, move faster, or drop when the arrow keys or space bar is pressed)

-collision detection
-an overarching array to store the coordinates of the pieces that have collided
-randomly chosed tetrad shapes which appear at the top of the screen after collision of last piece
